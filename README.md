GitHub: [Provide Link to Your GitHub Repository]

Project Overview: This project involves the development and deployment of a robust and responsive medical website hosted on Microsoft Azure, ensuring high availability and scalability using Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) and an Azure Load Balancer.

Key Features:

Responsive Medical Website: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website provides healthcare-related information and services. It ensures a user-friendly experience across various devices.
Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS): VM Scale Sets are used to automatically increase or decrease the number of virtual machines based on traffic demand, ensuring the website can handle high traffic loads without downtime.
Azure Load Balancer: Integrated to distribute incoming traffic evenly across multiple virtual machines, ensuring high availability and optimal performance.
High Availability: The system is designed to ensure that the website remains online and responsive even during peak traffic or in case of hardware failures.
Scalability: VMSS allows the infrastructure to automatically scale up or down depending on website traffic, optimizing performance and cost-efficiency.
Deployment on Microsoft Azure: Leveraging Azure's cloud platform for hosting, ensuring secure, reliable, and globally accessible infrastructure.
Technical Stack:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Cloud Platform: Microsoft Azure
Infrastructure: Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS), Azure Load Balancer
Objective: The project aims to provide a reliable online platform for medical services, ensuring uninterrupted access to healthcare information and resources, even during high traffic periods. This is achieved through cloud-based infrastructure that adapts to demand in real-time.

Outcomes:

Improved website uptime and performance.
Automatic scaling to meet varying user demands.
Enhanced user experience with a responsive and informative medical platform.
